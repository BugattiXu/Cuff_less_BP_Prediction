# Cuff less Blood Pressure Prediction 

Prediction of Blood Pressure from EEG and PPG signals using regression methods. 

### Dataset:

Dataset :  [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00340/)

This database consist of a cell array of matrices, each cell is one record part. 

In each matrix each row corresponds to one signal channel: 

1: PPG signal, FS=125Hz; photoplethysmograph from fingertip 

2: ABP signal, FS=125Hz; invasive arterial blood pressure (mmHg) 

3: ECG signal, FS=125Hz; electrocardiogram from channel II 

### Feature Extraction:

<code> seven.m </code> - Code to extract the first 7 features (WN,PIR,PTT,HR,IH,IL,Meu)
<code> seven.m </code> - Code to extract the ppg features
